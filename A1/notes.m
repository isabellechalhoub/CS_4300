% Notes from class:
% A1.pdf, CS4300_agent1.m, CS4300_A1_driver.m (statistics), all of his
% source code. - Handin - seperately? Make sure the headers are right
% PDF: Page numbers, section headings, method: simple descriptions,
% verification: uniform distribution (for the agent) get a bunch of samples
% how many time each one shows up (histogram)
% look at the example PDF.
% res = zeros(1000,1)
% for t = 1:1000
%    res(t) = CS4300_agent1(zeros(1,5));
% end
% hist(res);
% did you find the gold? trace = CS4300_WW2(); - see if it gets to 2,2.
% length(trace) = how long it lived.
% do this for various max_steps.
% mean of how many times u get gold, mean steps survived
% need to add a question?
% figures need captions and labels
